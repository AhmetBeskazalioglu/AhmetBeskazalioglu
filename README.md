- 🎯 About Me 🎯
  
    <p align="left">Hello, I joined a bootcamp program dedicated to software testing and went through an intensive 8-month course. I previously learned Python and have experience in pulling data from Excel and testing using VBA. I have also realized automation projects with UI Path and I have certificates in this field. In addition to my IT experience, 
      I have worked in various sectors and gained team management experience. I hold leadership and coaching certificates and have conducted trainings for both children and adults. I am a team-oriented professional who is open to innovations and can adapt quickly. I continuously update my technical knowledge and strive for excellence in testing processes. 
      I value communication as it helps us overcome obstacles, embrace innovations, and excel in processes. As a trainer, my written and verbal communication skills are professional. It is exciting for me to take part in new projects and produce solutions compatible with developing technologies. 
      I would like to state that I am looking for a team where I can contribute to my professional development. I look forward to collaborating on new projects.</p>
